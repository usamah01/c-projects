 * This class represents a simple picture. You can draw the picture using
 * the draw method. But wait, there's more: being an electronic picture, it
 * can be changed. You can set it to black-and-white display and back to
 * colors (only after it's been drawn, of course).
 *
 * This class was written as an early example for teaching Java.
